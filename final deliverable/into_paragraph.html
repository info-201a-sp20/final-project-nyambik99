    <h1> Sleepless in America </h1>
    
    <p>
      As sleep-deprived college students, we were all curious about what factors go into a better sleep schedule. We hope that the data we find from these data sets will enable us to understand how we can all develop better sleep schedules. Our data set is about how much time Americans spend sleeping. By using and visualizing our dataset through different charts, graphs, summary tables, and functions, we were able to understand the relationships between sleep, age, genders, types of days, and different years.
